<h1>Welcome, Higher Education Recruiters and Admissions:</h1>
<p>Interested in recruiting veterans to your program but don’t know where to find them or how to effectively market to them?</p>
<p>Need coaching on developing and implementing best practices to ensure your veteran students have the resources and support they need to succeed in the classroom and beyond?</p>
<p>Combat2Career’s exclusive web-based portal and social community was designed with your needs in mind. We understand how difficult it can be to locate and attract veterans to your program. Further, we recognize that it can be challenging for civilian recruiters and admissions officers to relate to military experience or realize the value that veterans can bring to the classroom. That’s why we’ve developed a robust set of tools and training programs to facilitate the recruitment process and ensure your program offers the services and resources needed to attract and engage veteran students.</p>
<p>Contact us for more information about how we can help make your program more veteran-friendly. info@combat2career.com or 1-800-984-4582.</p>
